# Cache and Memory Hierarchy Simulator

This C++ project involves designing a cache and memory hierarchy simulator to explore and evaluate various cache configurations, including different sizes, associations, and hierarchies. The simulator implements a Least-Recently-Used (LRU) replacement policy and a Write-Back + Write-Allocate (WBWA) policy to measure cache performance by calculating cache miss rates.

This is an academic project under the course Microprocessor Architecture at North Carolina State University.

## Features

- **Cache Simulation**: Simulate various cache sizes and configurations.
- **Replacement Policies**: Implements LRU replacement policy.
- **Write Policies**: Supports WBWA (Write-Back + Write-Allocate) policy.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Calculates and evaluates cache miss rates.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
- Make

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shirazanwar97/CacheAndMemoryHierarchyDesignSimulator
   ```

2. Build the project using Make:

   ```bash
   make all
   ```
